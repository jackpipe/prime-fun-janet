# prime-fun-janet

Prime number sieve, Sacks and Ulam spiral generator in Janet, teaching my kids coding.

We started with a few 'is prime?' functions using iteration and then a filter anbd reduce. Then a 'primes' function to actually generate primes.

Then then a new implementation of primes generator, using sieve of eratosthenes algorithm, but using a table to record primes as we hit them, rather than the usual method of marking 'future' composites in a big array.

Finally there is a function to generate a Sacks spiral and one for an Ulam spiral, and some SVG utility functions to generate them as SVG.

A nice little exercise in coding adn an introduction to Janet and 'lisp'-like languiages my kids. And me, to some extent, actually.
